Chicago Cubs co-owner wont join Trump Cabinet: report
kennedy looks to election gains  they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics  the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition  but the liberal democrats are entering the expected  election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his partys ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test  and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the partys westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election  the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow  as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson  that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than  a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election  there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as selfdelusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats  labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name 
kennedy predicts bigger turnout  voters pent up passion could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election charles kennedy has said  the liberal democrat leader predicted concerns over iraq and other international and domestic issue would express themselves during the campaign his comments come as an inquiry looks at how best to boost voter turnouts exforeign secretary robin cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of pager politics and not being heard he like mr kennedy pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the iraq war  mr cook who is giving evidence to the power inquiry into voter turnout rates told bbc radio s today programme it was not fair to blame the public who were more interested in politics than ever before they are turned off by the way we do politics in britain theres a message there for politicians he urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to speak more from the heart we should be not so afraid to say what we stand for he also criticised the cult of personality politics theres far too much interest in celebrities politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry the government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout which fell to  in the last general election in  this has included bringing in directly elected mayors to head local authorities and trialling postal voting 
howard attacks pay later budget  tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon browns budget as vote now pay later spending plans  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole mr howard said everyone could see the chancellors sweeteners but these hid tax rises for hard working families he said labours faltering election campaign would not be helped by the package of measures mr howard added  mr browns budget was not about what was good for the country but all about the interests of the labour party the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging millions of people in to the net to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax we can all see the sweeteners but they hide the crippling tax rises for hardworking families that are inevitable if labour wins  he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste  to get people to vote now and pay later mr brown liked to rattle off magical balances conjured out of thin air in a bid to convince people there was no black hole in the nations finances the tory leader said this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers he said you now propose to borrow over the next six years no less than  billion so much for prudence the chancellors forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime ministers forecasts of weapons of mass destruction  mr browns council tax rebate for pensioners was  less than what the tories were offering mr howard said there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools people would face a clear choice at the election either more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives he said thats the battleground of this election thats what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on he concluded to loud tory cheering 
expm lord callaghan dies aged   former labour prime minister lord callaghan has died on the eve of his rd birthday  he passed away at home in east sussex just  days after his wife audrey died aged  lord callaghan who leaves a son and two daughters was the longest living former british pm in history he entered downing street in  after the resignation of harold wilson prime minister tony blair called him a giant of the labour movement he held each of the major offices of chancellor home secretary foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became lord callaghan of cardiff in   chancellor gordon brown said the former pm would be mourned throughout the world it was a commitment to public service that brought jim callaghan into parliament in  and while jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots former cabinet colleague lord hattersley said his first reaction on hearing the news was immense sadness  it was not a major surprise  i knew what a blow the death of his wife audrey was a few days ago he said he was a decent kindly man who helped me and my generation of politicians immensely  the labour party and the country will be poorer without him conservative peer lord heseltine said that despite their political differences he and lord callaghan became friends you dont get to the premiership unless you have a streak of determination he said but i saw the other side of jim callaghan he became a personal friend in a way and my family and i were very fond of him tory leader michael howard said he would be remembered with affection and respect liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said when i was first elected in  as the youngest mp he was the father of the house and as such took a very keen interest in my early days in parliament  he was always full of warmth and wisdom born in  and educated at portsmouth northern secondary school lord callaghan became a clerk at the inland revenue he enlisted in the royal navy in  and rose to the rank of lieutenant elected for a cardiff constituency at the  general election he represented cardiff seats for more than  years after serving as a junior minister in the attlee government he became chancellor of the exchequer when labour returned to power in   with sterling under pressure he resisted devaluation for three years before being forced into it in  his political career was not without controversy when he refused to support prime minister harold wilson and dame barbara castle over the latters trade union manifesto in place of strife in  he said i am not going to resign they will have to throw me out when home secretary he ordered british troops to march into the streets of belfast to protect catholic civilians amid rising violence  a decision that has dominated british politics into the st century  as foreign secretary in the early s lord callaghan kept an open mind about the uks entry into the common market seeing the advantages of the uks entry he once travelled to idi amins uganda in  to plead for the life of a british lecturer dennis hills who was under a death sentence for treason  his political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party in the autumn of  before the winter of discontent when trade unions carried out strikes that brought the country to a standstill lord callaghan refused to hold an early election which may have delivered a labour victory as garbage lay uncollected in the streets and hospital staff council workers and even gravediggers stayed off work lord callaghan failed to predict the mood of the country when britain went to the polls in  tory leader margaret thatcher was swept into power in a landslide victory and lord callaghan resigned as labour leader 
councils must find gypsy sites  ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments  councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks said housing minister yvette cooper in november mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because  travellers have no place to stop ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places that scheme has paid out m in four years with m available for   there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper firstly local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites and secondly they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the shortterm because of risk to local amenity and the environment under the new regulations expected to be in force in the spring officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban many mps with rural constituencies particularly in eastern england have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments  andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers as they often do living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals legal action and eviction is no ones idea of fun in their november report mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister responsible for housing said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities said the mps in turn the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents two of the most controversial traveller sites  cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire  remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle

prepoll clash on tax and spend  labour and the tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over gordon browns budget turned into a full scale preelection battle  tony blair claimed a tory government would cut bn from public services hitting schools hospitals and police tory chairman liam fox accused labour of at best misrepresentation at worst a downright lie and said the smear tactics were a sign of desperation the lib dems accused mr brown of ducking the issue of council tax rises  appearing together at a labour poster launch the prime minister hailed his chancellors brilliant performance and he claimed the tories would cut bn from public services which was the equivalent of sacking every doctor and teacher in the uk  the tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans  leading to a total of bn less spending than that anticipated by labour by  but they say not a single doctor teacher or nurse will be cut dr fox said we have said we will be spending more year on year over and above inflation and to call that a cut is at best a misrepresentation at worst a downright lie  tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin also predicted mr brown would have to raise taxes by bn or bn if labour was reelected because he was borrowing and spending too much for the lib dems vince cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the looming problems of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in massive increases for some mr brown and mr blair staged a show of unity on thursday morning the day after the chancellor delivered a recordbreaking ninth budget  mr cable said taxation as a share of the economy would go up under all three of the main parties the chancellor meanwhile insisted his spending plans were affordable in wednesdays budget mr brown doubled the level at which homebuyers pay stamp duty unveiled a rise in child tax credit and a  council tax refund for overs defending the plans he told today i will take no risks with the stability of the economy all our spending plans announced yesterday wednesday including what we can do for pensioners as well as for young families and on stamp duty and inheritance tax all these are costed and affordable in a further sign if any were needed that the election is approaching the house of commons authorities have formally told mps their offices will be deep cleaned during the threeweek poll campaign mr blair has yet to name the day  but it is widely expected to be  may

brown in appeal for labour unity  gordon brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed mr blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election  the chancellor would not comment on the reports but insisted he would not be diverted or distracted from tackling the challenges faced by the country his only motivation was to ensure labour was reelected he insisted mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news according to a new book browns britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june   in an interview with bbc ones breakfast with frost mr blair said ive dealt with this six months ago i said then you dont do deals over jobs like this  you dont what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country  in a separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr mr brown said its very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government i think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that i have that is my purpose in politics and that is what every day i seek to do and i am not going to be diverted or distracted nor is tony blair by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip the only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do  but mr peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other and that mr blair had decided in november  he would quit because he felt he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war he then changed his mind in june  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book andrew marr said this is enormously damaging gordon brown knows it as well as tony blair i think the relationship is genuinely privately very poor indeed things are very difficult he added lots of ministers believe tony blair will attempt to move gordon brown out of the treasury after the election that depends on whether theres still a labour government and their majority  senior mps are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of labour backbenchers on monday  health secretary john reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging labours reelection chances and would not be easily forgiven fresh speculation of a rift recently followed mr blair and mr browns separate responses to the asian tsunami these rumours were fuelled by mr blairs decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a longplanned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each others response to the disaster but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a load of nonsense tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown ofsquabbling like schoolboys liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was getting in the way of good government 
tory leader quits legal position  david mcletchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role  the scottish conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with tods murray did not influence the causes he supports but on friday he said i have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect mr mcletchie had received advice from holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare labour said he had cleverly not asked about paid advocacy a tory spokesman totally refuted any wrongdoing  mr mcletchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport the msp had been a partner for tods murray which has a client opposing the development mr mcletchie did not have a complaint made against him but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong  explaining his reason for quitting the post mr mcletchie said i have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with tods murray however i have no wish to see a similar situation arise again to avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of tods murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled i have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year i am proud to have been a part of tods murray for the last  years and wish it well in the future  labour msp christine may had said mr mcletchie was very clever to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section  of the code he was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section  the section on paid advocacy she said section  of the members interest order legally obliges msps to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner however msps code of conduct recognises a wider definition of parliamentary proceedings including a nonstatutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices such as motions  but a letter from holyroods chamber office chief ken hughes also made clear that mr mcletchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor commenting on mr mcletchies decision to stand down a scottish labour party spokesman said this should mean mr mcletchie doesnt breach the paid advocacy rules in future however it doesnt change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past  scottish national party holyrood leader nicola sturgeon accused mr mcletchie of failing to properly serve his constituents ms sturgeon said i think this whole episode has been very damaging for mr mcletchie and im sure he will be reflecting on it she added that she thought that the tories were an irrelevant party so she would not lose any sleep over it peter misselbrook executive partner of tods murray said mr mcletchie had been considering retirement later in the year he added david has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so 
child access law shakeup planned  parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers  curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied lord falconer said the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday he denied fathers activists had forced the changes telling the bbc there is a recognition that something is wrong between  and  couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year although in nine out of  separations there is no court intervention  lord falconer told bbc radio s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court but he opposed compulsory mediation saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude other plans include   parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements based on reallife examples that have worked in the past    extending incourt conciliation  more informal hearings before contested court cases    better access to legal emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet    legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes  judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a nuclear option which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the childs interests a spokesman said the aim of the new legislation was to provide a medium range of penalties such as fines community service orders compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews  failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents lord falconer said tagging may be going too far but lets have a debate about that full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published in the next two weeks a spokesman said  the governments proposals have met with disapproval from fathers rights groups john ison from the controversial group fathers  justice said it is very disappointing what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation jim parton from families need fathers said the new proposals lacked compulsion  we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order  then you know where you stand you know what the minimum access is otherwise you see people make agreements which then fall apart mr parton said he had been told by childrens minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election which is likely to take place in may  the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law theresa may shadow secretary for the family told bbc radio s today programme that the governments plans were inadequate and were papering over the cracks of the current system she said a conservative government would bring a radical reform of the family courts as well as enforcing a legal presumption of coparenting and compulsory mediation we want to make courts the last resort rather than the first resort she added the government says children cannot simply be divided up like property when a marriage collapses the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules rather than having rigid targets 
campaign cold calls questioned  labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls  the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing  for instance by asking about peoples voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioners office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the runup to the general election  but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications  the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service  he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations in summary whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue  earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them

escaped prisoner report ordered  first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded  michael ferguson  escaped after being allowed out of the highsecurity carstairs unit the snps nicola sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report ministerial responsibility for carstairs rests with rhona brankin the deputy health minister ms brankin said the first minister has called for a review of what has happened we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this ms sturgeon has written to mr mcconnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out she said questions must be answered about his escape if the public is to be reassured about safety police are still searching for ferguson who failed to return after a trip to east kilbride on monday  the scottish national partys parliamentary leader argued that under the law authorisation of fergusons leave of absence would have come directly from ministers she said the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs however my understanding is that under the mental health legislation the decision to grant this patient  and any restricted patient  leave of absence would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers she added i have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact i have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on this is not an attempt to apportion blame but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases  police said ferguson posed a danger to the public bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation he said we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised scottish conservative leader david mcletchie said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen  the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers she said ministers were told of that notified of it but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off they do have statutory responsibility but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision ferguson who slashed a man in a doctors surgery in coatbridge in  had been out to see his fiance annabella holmes  whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire he is described as being ft ins tall slim with blond hair blue eyes and a fair complexion ferguson was wearing a black jacket grey jeans black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen he has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye ms holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of ferguson since monday strathclyde police asked anyone who spots ferguson to contact sergeant keith mcdonald on   
parliaments record of scandal  in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal  sex betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson  few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den for sprinkled among  floors of archives are blowbyblow accounts of marital breakups  and now you can search whats there online until  the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed remarriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or lifethreatening cruelty the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings dating back to  all recorded among the  items which fill the  floors of the parliamentary archives in parliaments victoria tower most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love this gives them the chance  divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses among the records is the story of jane campbell the first woman ever to divorce her husband that happened in  after she had discovered her husband edward addison had committed adultery with her sister jessy  a transcript of evidence from jessys maid amelia laugher shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed it must have been a killer blow to addisons case  he had already fled abroad rather than pay the  damages ordered by a civil court as well as making divorce history jane campbell won custody of her children  unusual for a woman at the time but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament  there are the protestation returns from   lists of the protestants who pledged to maintain the true reformed protestant religion there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament including composer george frideric handel in  and the mass of private bills which for example authorise the building of railways and roads contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them  tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters  the longest stretches for about m and is longer than the palace of westminster itself listing the names of appointed tax collectors this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue david prior assistant clerk of the archives says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research before you just could not do it you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material he says mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change mainly motivated by the potential of it which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us he says  the archives do of course hold records of high and low politics too for both houses of parliament including copies of all acts passed since   the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk records for the commons only date back to   anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in   but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history  parts of the bill of rights from  the death warrant for charles i the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law there is also the  act establishing  november as a thanksgiving day  the year after the gunpowder plot that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the th anniversary of guy fawkes conspiracy as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum parchment made from goats skin all human life is here 
election deal faltered over heath role  the tories failed to hold onto power in  after liberals demanded sir edward heath quit in return for cooperation  documents released after  years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic february general election liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government but it partly collapsed over the conservative leaders own role prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form a labour government the february  general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control sir edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis a miners strike and the subsequent threeday week labour emerged with the most seats  but its  mps were  short of the number mr wilson needed to form a majority  sir edward who had received more votes but had fewer mps believed he had the authority to remain at number  providing the  liberal mps would support his government he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the governments programme or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal mr thorpe was in high spirits having just led his party to a historic jump in support he also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties but sir edward said that was impossible because the labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a conservativeliberal pact  hours later sir edwards hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpes colleagues refused to support him jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally reads a telephone memo for mr heath  they feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister asked if this was his own view he said  no it was not i am very close to ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve  it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult the following day the stickling points had clearly become twofold mr thorpes colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edwards resignation mr thorpe told sir edward i am sorry this is obviously hell  a nightmare on stilts for you somehow i personally hope that we can work something out  four hours later sir edward called the liberal leader back to downing street in a last attempt at a deal the minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister mr thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime ministers colleagues documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a labourled coalition but he already knew mr wilson would not form a coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government 
fox attacks blairs tory lies  tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign say the tories  tory cochairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda dr fox told bbc radio if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all he would not discuss reports the party repaid  to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat  the prime minister ratcheted up labours preelection campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the partys spring conference he insisted he did not know the poll date but it is widely expected to be  may  in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday mr blair said i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of  downing street he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric then struggling to live up to the expectations and reaching the point of raised voices and throwing crockery he warned his supporters against complacency saying its a fight for the future of our country its a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win  mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy it would result in a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents policies and then attacking the lies what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and its going to be fear and smear he told bbc news the tory cochairman attacked labours six new pledges as vacuous and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid  to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters he said insisting he enjoyed a warm and constructive relationship to lord ashcroft  meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blairs words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke shrewsbury dorset and torbay he said this is threeparty politics in the northern cities the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats in southern and rural seats  especially in the south west  the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives who are out of the running in scotland and wales the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a touchyfeely speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust 
will tory tax cuts lift spirits  michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts  should he win the next general election he has earmarked  billion that will be used to reduce taxes  although he still will not say which or how this was the preelection message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax  all the money would come from its  billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that  billion would go on spending plans with  billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eyecatching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts  the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard  can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned bn efficiency savings simply dont add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy  one of new labours greatest successes before the historic  election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely  and the prime minister probably hopes  that the economy will be the deciding factor 
tory backing for id cards  the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards  the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next weeks commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id the decision follows a tough meeting where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move party sources told the bbc the bill which ministers claim will tackle crime terrorism and illegal immigration is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats  they have said the scheme is deeply flawed and a waste of money sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary the party has been agnostic on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence the tory source said despite giving their backing to id cards the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether peoples privacy would be properly protected it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration  lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it the new chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped if they havent id cards they are going to be detained 
blair rejects tory terror offer  tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of antiterror legislation  the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the antiterrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november mr blair said the bill which brings in house arrest for terror suspects had time limiting safeguards already the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed the lib dems also oppose the plans  the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases  mr blairs refusal to accept the tories sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday the bill proposes control orders which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights  the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders not just house arrest shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio fours the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a recruiting sergeant for terrorists he went on to say if we dont get the amendments we regard as essential including the sunset clause we will vote against the bill in the commons mr howard said it would be far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable  the second less stringent type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within  days and there would be a threemonthly report on their use by an eminent and independent person i believe the new powers are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk said mr blair the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said theres a lot of talking left i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a basic principle that people should only be punished after a fair trial she added having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either

petrol duties frozen brown says  chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his prebudget speech to the commons on thursday  mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments but this financial year because of volatility in the oil market he said the duty would be frozen during  many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution he said it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties  the rac welcomed the news calling it an early christmas present for motorists but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol environmental group transport  said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action said a spokesman in  the peoples fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slowmoving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes the chancellor did not raise duty that year but despite threats of more protests in  he added p per litre

drink remark acts as diversion  the first ministers statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed  jack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnells comment was illadvised the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotlands binge drinking problems mr law said scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than  secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions  the onesentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and illadvised remark by the first minister if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage  mr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotlands fight against binge drinking he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink mr law added i think the remark was illadvised  but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland  we dont want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him he added here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to  teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark  the scottish national partys holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his illjudged comment and withdraw it immediately in a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context he told ms sturgeon it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i should encourage young people to get drunk that is completely untrue perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with  all for the sake of a simple soundbite

howard unveils tory asylum plans  tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees michael howard has said  as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas some charities say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled  tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans by cutting the number of frontline immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set  in a speech in london on monday mr howard said its not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that firm but fair immigration controls were essential for good community relations     withdrawing from the  united nations convention on refugees which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need not numbers    introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents    detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk  a worry for national security    stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin     the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australianstyle points system and those wanting to join families in the uk  mr howard said nearly  people were settling in the uk every year  the size of a city like peterborough the plans would help achieve a substantial reduction in immigration he said although he could not predict a figure he said that only two out of  asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current unfair and inhumane system  we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum mr howard said by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling  but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans dangerous ill thoughtout and hugely irresponsible lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled she warned commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down  and economic migration down about   he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture mr howard called that suggestion disgraceful

mps murder sentence concern  murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new mps report  the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse  the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor at present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff  the minimum term they must serve  if the defendant pleads guilty but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy in july this year amanda champions killer james ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least  years  it would have been longer had he denied the charge  amandas uncle lewis champion told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing lastminute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty  the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill  as a result says the committee the government may need to relegislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales lord woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty the committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers lord woolfs sentencing guidelines council sgc caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime as a result murderers who face a year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police  mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliaments wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence he said we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals he said by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial  shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences  such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the governments claim to be tough on crime he said but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different he told bbc news

blair ready to call election  tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on  may  the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll it has not shifted over the weeks there have been any number of signs that  was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labours stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust  and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign  to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster  to underline that economic message and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties tax and spend policies  during the phoney campaign labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning  bn cuts in public services the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labours plans was a cut and it looked like the labour campaign  which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health  was on the rocks then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger cuts  he was sacked for his gaffe but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track a second central argument will be over taxation with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again mr brown slaps that aside claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate as usual the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax other issues are certain to play a part  immigration and asylum the war on iraq law and order and education for example but as ever it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome and whatever that outcome  is set to be a far more lively even bitter campaign than s nonevent

eu rules wont stop uk spending  the shape of the uks economy in graphics  but he denied that he was ruling out british membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year mr brown said that it was vital the uk continued to invest in infrastructure science and education in the future otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of china he told mps  the chancellor said that the eus planned changes in the growth and stability pact  designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much  would force britain to run a budget surplus of  over the economic cycle  under mr browns rules the uk current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit he told the house of commons treasury select committee that the eu rules make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure but he argued that the eu was moving in the direction of the uk principles and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year to include investment and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year under mr browns sustainable investment rule government debt should be under   in contrast to the  allowed under the growth and stability pact  mr brown vigorously denied conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules in march the office of national statistics ons reclassified bn of spending on road repairs as public investment  shortly before the chancellor announced in the budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only bn conservative michael fallon asked mr brown whether the treasury had leaned on ons to make this change and said that the ons had received a written paper from the treasury on this matter but the chancellor said mr fallon was impugning the integrity of the office of national statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently mr brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap he told the treasury select committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost treasury coffers  earlier exconservative chancellor ken clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone speaking on radio s today programme mr clarke said political give and take would replace more rigid rules but fellow tory david heathcoatamory said the folly of the system was in trying to run europes varied economies on one set of rules the essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake he said the warning is about the european constitution which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution it gives more powers to brussels to coordinate things like employment and economic policy but speaking to the treasury select committee gordon brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding treaty and could be changed again the future  potentially opening the way for future euro membership the conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact mr brown said 
noone can define new hunt ban  the new law banning hunting with dogs is so poorly drafted noone can define the offence prohunt mps say  the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to chase away unwanted animals from his farm because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting  chasing away  and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules  north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group of which mr opik is a cochairman after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry defra he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence  prompting him to complain the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defras lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act  therefore you would not be committing an offence  mr opik said hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting  chasing away which isnt even covered by the act however all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting exempt hunting drag hunting unintentional hunting a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away tory mp peter luff another cochairman of middle way said that the legislation was so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence  it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law however i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating mike hobday of the league against cruel sports said there is no confusion it is a matter of simple common sense if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer then nobody can define that as hunting
