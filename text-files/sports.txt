record fails to lift lacklustre meet  yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham  and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record  apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets  so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish  it would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i havent seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests frances ronald pognon  who has run  seconds  will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet  something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the womens national m race in a new personal best of  seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong xm squad going to the european championships scotlands lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the m but i dont think the pacemaking was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the mens m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly 
edu describes tunnel fracas  arsenals edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed manchester uniteds win over the gunners  the brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at united boss sir alex ferguson i saw people being pulled apart people pushing pointing and shouting he told uefas official website the united players were trying to wind us up about the result but i didnt see any soup being thrown at anyone however edu tried to play down the incidents adding there was nothing that i havent seen in brazilian derbies derby matches in brazil are worse i like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry but edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of uniteds challenges during the game particularly on jose antonio reyes i think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than united he said reyes was being kicked all over the park  they were beating up the boy and gary neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off following the game the football association said it would look into events in the tunnel it also charged ruud van nistelrooy with serious foul play while arsenal boss arsene wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee 
ogara revels in ireland victory  ireland flyhalf ronan ogara hailed his sides  victory over england as a special win  the munster number  kicked a total of  points including two drop goals to help keep alive their grand slam hopes he told bbc sport we made hard work of it but its still special to beat england i had three chances to win the game but didnt we have work to do after this but we never take a victory over england lightly ireland hooker shane byrne echoed ogaras comments but admitted the game had been englands best outing in the six nations byrne said it was a really really hard game but from one to  in our team we worked really really hard we just had to stick to our defensive pattern trust ourselves and trust those around us all round it was fantastic ireland captain brian odriscoll who scored his sides only try said we are delighted we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter we did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and youve just got to jump on the back of it  ireland coach eddie osullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break andy was sitting two yards from me and i couldnt see whether he was offside or not so i dont know how andy could have known said osullivan  what i do know is that england played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us we had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team i think our try was very well worked it was a gem as good a try as we have scored for a while osullivan also rejected robinsons contention england dominated the forward play i think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so i dont know how that adds up to domination he said odriscoll also insisted ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the six nations title this season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites tag he said hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so as for my try it was a move we had worked on all week there was a bit of magic from geordan murphy and it was a great break from denis hickie 
unclear future for striker baros  liverpool forward milan baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss rafa benitezs plans after being dropped for the carling cup final  baros who is liverpools leading scorer this season denied reports of a row with benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench he told czech newspaper daily sport i dont know why i didnt play on sunday i didnt argue with anybody i was disappointed but i am not thinking of leaving right now the czech international came on as a substitute after  minutes but could not prevent his side losing  to chelsea after extratime  baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the millennium stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting lineup but his admission that he guessed something like this was going to happen on saturday will do little to quell claims of a fallingout with benitez and although baros insisted thoughts of quitting anfield are not in my mind right now he admitted everything is possible

oconnell rejects lions rumours  ireland and munster lock paul oconnell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer  oconnell is rumoured to be among the frontrunners for the job but says he is totally focused on sundays six nations crunch clash with england i honestly dont think about these reports he told bbc sport the lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk nothing more i just ignore it and get on with my job he added the only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think i can just imagine them saying im going to show this guy whats what about second row play thats the one thing that makes me cringe oconnell who made a tryscoring international debut against wales two years ago is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugbys shop window  but refuses to be drawn on the lions  i have spoken to sir clive woodward a few times but not for very long certainly nothing about summer holidays he joked he also said he remains wary of wounded englands abilities coming into sundays game after two straight defeats dismissing predictions of a certain irish victory its very dangerous to think that this england team has so much experience and skill you do not become a bad team overnight they have two world class gamebreakers in josh lewsey and jason robinson while charlie hodgson is just ready to click into place he insisted ireland will not make the mistake of being overconfident thats not going to happen in our squad no ireland team lining up to play england will ever fall into that trap he said every time we play england we know what a big task it is look at what they did to us two years ago i remember that game all too well and it was not a good feeling i came on as a replacement and we were losing  and ended up getting hammered  so i know what can happen when england come to dublin they could so easily have been coming to dublin with two wins and staring a grand slam in the face as well

moya emotional after davis cup win  carlos moya described spains davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usas challenge in seville  moya made up for missing spains  victory through injury by beating roddick      to give the hosts an unassailable  lead i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya all my energy has been focused on today what i have lived today i do not think i will live again spains only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia and moya nicknamed charly admitted the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed its really incredible  to get the winning point is really something spanish captain jordi arrese said charly played a great game it was his opportunity and he hasnt let us down he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him he had been waiting years to be in this position spains victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles  aged  years and  days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup what a great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better obviously its unrealistic to say that were going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of sevilles olympic stadium its just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three claycourters in the world said the american i had my chances and just didnt convert them the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend they came out took care of business and they beat us its as simple as that 
 an irish athletics year   wont be remembered as one of irish athletics great years  the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad but come late august a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics  or to be more accurate the lack of it sonia osullivans olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers but after the disastrous buildup to the games we shouldnt have been surprised at the start of the year an osullivan had been earmarked as irelands best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury less than a week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo lombards shattering of mark carrolls national m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a twoyear ban from the sport  back at preolympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things couldnt have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens once the track and field action began in athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair craggs performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the m final did offer hope for the future our beloved sonia scraped into the womens k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shakeup as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the  hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a worldclass field at the flora lite k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over its unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition at least sonia managed to make it to athens at the start of the year several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an outofform and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of  and an early exit  james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane the injuryplagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the m qualifying mark but  was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckees athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in  pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injuryravaged years donnelly and his annadale striders teammates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on  december a large turnout of athleticsloving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andys many friends as only death can it put the years athletics happenings in a sharp perspective 
funding cut hits wales students  the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby unions reorganisation at youth level  an amalgamated under side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday against italy at the gnoll but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students as a result traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union reverend eldon phillips said it is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge that is representative rugby but this year that opportunity will be denied them players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones rob howley jon humphreys darren morris martyn williams and ceri sweeney

englands defensive crisis grows  englands defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of tottenhams ledley king from the squad to face holland  chelseas john terry and wayne bridge are also out leaving coach svengoran eriksson with a real problem for wednesdays match at villa park injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad and matthew upson has already pulled out wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership terry the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title would have been a certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand but now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher alongside brown  manchester uniteds brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february  the yearold was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson who has a hamstring injury and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for england king was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by englands medical staff eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further backup having already summoned phil neville after bridge pulled out with a foot injury 
time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the  minutes at the end  i would say its  whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarterfinals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first  minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole teams worth the debate will rage on and im not sure there is a satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you englands game against holland is a good example it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember svengoran erikssons side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed 
osullivan keeps his powder dry  when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential  ireland coach eddie osullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the runup to this seasons six nations championship he decreed after the  world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year that became a reality at the end of last summer with a week period at the start of the this season it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday but like osullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it the irfu has thrown their weight behind osullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrallycontrolled contracts bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg everyone of osullivans squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this seasons campaign  but i doubt whether osullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players he is not that sort of person however he may look at the overworked and injuryhit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season a first grand slam since karl mullens led the team to a clean sweep in  with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman  under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled take the triple crownwinning side of  under mick doyle they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam only the second in irelands history what happened in  whitewashed you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary it is the nature of the beast but osullivans side are very capable of proving a salient point this season after their first triple crown for  years they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder osullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades  and there is more to come he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this seasons championship with a different box of tricks and a new verve to succeed ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it

newcastle  bolton  kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end boltons game unbeaten run  lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended a fluid passing move with a wellstruck volley but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearers shot was blocked and firing into the top corner neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the firsthalf  keeping out shearers low shot and dyers closerange header  but that was the only goalmouth action of note and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on  minutes bowyer found space with a neat turn on the halfway line and striding forward picked out carr to his right he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carrs cross with a downward header into the far corner bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well  they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos jayjay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with a firsttime strike the magpies were opened up again before halftime as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post but the home side survived and they should have retaken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant freekick laurent robert curled the ball just wide bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies their strategy seemed to be working until the th minute alan shearers snapshot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards   bolton boss sam allardyce i am bitterly disappointed with the result but i am probably more disappointed with the secondhalf performance in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked    newcastle boss graeme souness we deserved the win we had a really good second half bolton are a difficult side to play you have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football we had a slow first  minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that the scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals newcastle given carr boumsong bramble babayaro dyer faye bowyer robert jenas  ameobi shearer subs not used butt harper milner hughes goals bowyer  dyer  bolton jaaskelainen hunt fadiga  ngotty ben haim candela giannakopoulos okocha vaz te  hierro campo  speed gardner davies subs not used jaidi poole booked ben haim hierro goals giannakopoulos  att  ref s dunn gloucestershire

robertson out to retain euro lure  hearts manager john robertson hopes a place in the knockout stages of the uefa cup could help keep some of his outofcontract players at the club  it could help if we get through and have another european tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season he said if we manage to get through it shows how well the clubs progressing they have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on a win for robertsons side against ferencvaros would put them through to the last  if basle fail to beat feyenoord its very much the players prerogative but the fact that weve been playing european football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive added robertson but we want players who want to play for the football club who are committed and a run in europe always helps a little bit with the game being played at murrayfield instead of tynecastle because of uefa regulations robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue  the pitch is not in the greatest condition the heineken cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare he said its not ideal but its the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform thats the most important thing but he added if tynecastle could have hosted  it would have been fantastic but thats one of the benefits of murrayfield  it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it there will be a good atmosphere and the hearts fans have an important role to play we need their encouragement we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible hopefully the players will respond to that and i know they will because its a fantastic european night for the club

wru proposes season overhaul  the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks  the season would start with the celtic league in october followed by the heineken cup in february and march and the six nations moved to april and may after a nine week break the wru then proposes a twomonth period of away and home international matches wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country he added we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed pickering added its very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it  not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important weve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits

european medal chances improve  what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects  it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around  the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the m hurdles running subeight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a headtohead race will give sarah confidence in the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the mens m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid  phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him  but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency  and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and m hurdles and you cant ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what weve seen so far  she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasnt all good news in sheffield i thought both the m races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasnt at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him hes there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the womens race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker  janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a twoyear drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldnt be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them

athens memories soar above lows  well its goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens  obviously theres no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but i want to remind you of a few more events that made  another year to remember  or forget  for athletics      one of my favourite olympic moments was kellys success in the m  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the m would be a bit of a formality kelly had been full of should i shouldnt i thoughts about going for the double in athens i thought why wouldnt you do the m its your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story      the victory for the british mens xm relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games i think the four of them  jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis  knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake      hicham el guerroujs olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kellys on a global scale  he was the first man since for  years to win both the m and m titles as soon as he had added the m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good      what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the m five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day  things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon  miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall the positive thing to take from paulas olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people  including me      purely as a race paulas victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nipandtuck between her and kenyas susan chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out      kelly and the xm boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that were not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level  the only individual mens finalist on the track was michael east in the m i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and thats where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the m and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the beijing olympics and beyond      i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special      to be honest im getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on  having said that im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it

hewitt survives nalbandian epic  home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic fiveset battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semifinals  hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a twoset lead but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the th game and served out to win      and set up a meeting with andy roddick the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets  the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitts exuberant oncourt celebrations were not very good for the sport and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip and he doublefaulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes i just kept hanging in there it was always tough serving second in the fifth set said hewitt who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again its a long way from holding that trophy up there but im hanging in there only four guys left that can win and were the top four in the world its set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals

celts savour grand slam prospect  the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam playoff in three weeks time  but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french noone knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on  march  sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham but how the mighty have fallen england sat on rugbys summit  months ago as world champions and  grand slam winners but they have lost nine of their  matches since that heady night in sydney and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon playoff against italy in a fortnight  england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in  coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost a phalanx of world cup stars and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team the same year that england ruled the roost a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations and they won only two games against scotland and italy in  wales most recent championship title was in  and their last grand slam success came in  in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al  but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with a broken thumb accurate kicking from either flyhalf stephen jones or centre gavin henson a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams ireland coach eddie osullivan and captain brian odriscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearlymen tag that has dogged them for the past few years the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runnersup for the past two years to france and england  but they have not won the title since  and last clinched a grand slam in  as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the  wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in  italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in  coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials and so to france brilliant one minute inept the next but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on  march 
dallaglio his own man to the end  controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career  even the end of his nineyear career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in   rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in  it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three backrow positions at international standard  within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captains band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the  lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england teammate martin johnson he played a massive role in the  series victory but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in   first came the lastminute defeat to wales in which dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use  of which he was subsequently cleared  splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson as a member of a newlook england side on the long road to world cup glory  a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned  dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again  yet another setback arrived in  as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglios involvement on the lions tour to australia  rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre  the only player to play every minute of englands world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure englands historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnsons retirement dallaglios career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglios second spell as captain losing five of their eight postworld cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of englands most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country  the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglios role as captain but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the yearold although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no standout candidate speaks volumes about dallaglios massive influence on english rugby

rusedski angry over supplements  greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of mens tennis for not releasing contaminationfree supplements in time for the new season  rusedski said i tried to order some but didnt receive any and i havent got any yet you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond this event comes in the hottest period of the year so you would hope the stuff would be available for it the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements in response the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contaminationfree drinks and nutritional bars for the mens tour  david higdon vice president of the atp admitted i agree with greg i would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but its a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing the reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with gsk has an education component we werent going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them  the first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the saturday before the australian open and rusedski who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial the good thing is that there is now a  guarantee so hopefully all this will never happen again said rusedski hopefully after the australian open we wont have to discuss this any more

man city  man utd  manchester united reduced chelseas premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city  wayne rooney met gary nevilles cross to the near post with a low shot which went in via a deflection off richard dunne to put united ahead seven minutes later the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james head and into his own net steve mcmanaman wasted citys best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half in the opening  minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance  a paul scholes header over the bar and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern only shaun wrightphillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems  wes brown also found wrightphillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline wrightphillips sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pinpoint centre to the feet of mcmanaman but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by sidefooting the easy chance wide john oshea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some muchneeded pace into the united attack rooney was being well marshalled by dunne  but that was all about to change after the break united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of citys best firsthalf chance rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it  even if he needed the help of dunnes leg worse was to come for dunne who had been having a fine match on  minutes he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooneys cross and united seemed home and dry however city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post   manchester city boss kevin keegan we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much but we still had four good chances two after wed gone  down the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from    manchester united boss sir alex ferguson it wasnt our best performance of the last three months but i think were deserved winners at times especially in the first half we didnt play with enough speed but with cristiano ronaldo and ryan giggs on the speed improved derby games can be like that they can be scrappy dull horrible and it was maybe like that man city james mills bradley wrightphillips  dunne distin thatcher shaun wrightphillips barton macken  sibierski mcmanaman musampa fowler subs not used weaver onuoha flood booked fowler sibierski man utd carroll gary neville ferdinand brown heinze oshea ronaldo  keane fortune fletcher giggs  rooney scholes phil neville  subs not used howard bellion booked rooney scholes keane goals rooney  dunne  og att  ref s bennett kent 
souness delight at euro progress  boss graeme souness felt newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the uefa cup against heerenveen  an early own goal followed by an alan shearer strike earned them a  win and a place in the uefa cup last  obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage he said after the  aggregate victory we got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous shearers goal moved him within  of jackie milburns club scoring record of  for the magpies but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season i think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway he added  he struck the ball very well  he always has done  and i think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper souness also paid tribute to laurent robert who was at the heart of much of uniteds attacking play in the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player more of the same in future please he said

benitez delight after crucial win  liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group  jorge andrades early own goal gave liverpool a  win and benitez said we started at a very high tempo and had many chances it is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack we are pleased but move on to the next game igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso and benitez said he played very well it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level benitez added it is all back in our own hands now it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen as far as my feelings about winning in spain that is really not important i want to see us win away matches in the champions league that it was in spain was not my first consideration as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in benitez added benitez said we had a problem before the start it was decided that xabi could not play more than  minutes but in the end because of the way that dietmar hamann and igor biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed but we knew that if we hit them on the counterattack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out deportivo coach javier irureta said liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down i know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination the goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it i know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that 
ireland win eclipses refereeing errors  the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go bellyup  it may have to go the whole way and have nflstyle video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself sundays explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since  the game was as exciting as it comes with a muchimproved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way one can understand that frustration there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their  victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sports blazers referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made after all he has no public recourse to criticism  it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cuetos first halfeffort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny oconnor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown but in rugby everything tends to even out over the  minutes the referee also missed englands danny grewcock taking out ronan ogara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line those were the standout moments in a classic game between the two old foes  but there were many more and one should not take away from those brian odriscolls winning try was as wellconceived as they come while charlie hodgsons brilliant kicking display was another highlight and ronan ogaras tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final  minutes two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on the first was denis hickies brilliant double tackle in the righthand corner he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson crossfield kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try irelands secondrow colossus paul oconnell was equally superb england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers unfortunately he ran into oconnell who hit him hard  very hard  and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover that spoke volumes about irelands backfoot display with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships 
mourinho plots impressive course  chelseas win at fulham  confirming their position at the premiership summit  proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season  they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain  they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won  at fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form as i said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is a priceless commodity noone can be anything other than highlyimpressed by mourinho he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho doesnt simply talk a good game  hes won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions ive also found him to be very realistic whenever ive heard him hes spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension  in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital i also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelseas squad i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind  if anything what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenals rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out  winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining fivefour is a hockey score not a football score in a threeagainstthree training match if the score reaches  i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get a result like that in a game of  against  is disgraceful  on a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenals defence confidence is a crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no  then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season
