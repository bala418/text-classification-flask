artists to watch published at the start of last year scissor sisters franz ferdinand keane joss stone and mcfly were all in the sound of  top  the other five brits winners were already established before sound of  was compiled the ceremony will be televised on itv on thursday    im speechless best song of the last  years yeah right  i very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out like every track robbie has released as a single its a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before  give us a break  best song in  years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but really  listened to angels on radio  this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfection  as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last  years that deserve this award more its not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low  im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last  years  what about the specials  ghost town the buzzcocks  ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays  kinky afro mcalmont  butler  yes joy division  love will tear us apart angels is middleoftheroad rubbish  angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap its musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result isnt very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music  best of the last  years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last  years after all  its alright for a pop song  but the best song of the last  years  there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last  yearsits a travesty  rubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio  but i dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last  years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out  where on earth did this dreadful list appear from  while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last  years should not include songs less than  years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show  youve got to be kidding  angels is a great song but not the best song of the last  years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits  i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i dont think its the best song from the past  years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place  he is alright but the song isnt that good im happy for robbie himself though  best song in the last  years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards  so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix still at least it wasnt will young  oh its all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even nonfans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent  i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and noone to slowdance with  i agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbie  i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isnt really that good a song it certainly isnt anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush  angels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers its a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups  robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late s and early s for example they werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think  yes angels is the best song since the past  years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning  ive always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british preteens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting its orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing  it is merely an irritating distraction  a wasp that refuses to go away on a summers afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it  you should feel ashamed of yourself  you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you  so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisss  angels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but  no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say  really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century  no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven yearold girl perhaps i mean will young come on  what a load of crap best song in the last  years  i dont think so what about all the real artists out there over the last  years  the list is endless but robbie williams doesnt even come close  what a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off why a halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past  years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up  why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last  years i think not i didnt realize radio  had so many listeners under the age of   people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last  years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here  the great british public at work again its a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted its not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nope  no because im not female and im not   ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past  years the shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is a joke  predictable and laughable  the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last  years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last  years  i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs  music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list  have radio  listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last  years than robbie williams ever will  no doubt about it theres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song  it should have been joy divisionthose guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in  years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today  yes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winner  i am astounded that such a secondrate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs its a terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music  the best song of the past  years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down  it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose its confirmed one thing  the british public are consistently dull  lt  no offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin  i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesnt deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust  obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it  if this is the best song of the last  years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record  a sad day for music  its not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people thats why it has been voted best song of the last  years its a good allrounder just like robbie  best song in  years since  im confused angels isnt a bad song its a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything its regressive bland even i suppose its just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become  granted angels is a good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition the queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for him  best song of the last  year
s what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasnt bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful  angels is without doubt a great song but i really dont think it deserves the title of best song in  yearsperhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song dont get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners  it would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with  people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob  i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past  years im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular  ive nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near us new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit  no surprise really its voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music  personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard  it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come  its an absolute joke however most of the original  were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise   the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of will young though  although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares  u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent  although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last  years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if thats all it means 
hard act to follow for outkast  us rap duo outkasts trio of trophies at the mtv europe awards crowns a year of huge success for the band  the latest triumph adds to the three grammys and four american mtv gongs won earlier in this year andre  and big bois album speakerboxxxthe love below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world the double album  which saw the pair produce one disc each  topped the charts in the us at the same time as single hey ya it took another track from the exponents of southern hiphop  the way you move  to displace it from the top spot the georgia pairs year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow  what can be next for a musical act that has done it all  g money a presenter on the bbcs urban music station xtra thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure  giving the band time to think about other interests they might be more appearances outside the band such as producing for other artists while they have a number of fringe music projects andre  would like to go into acting so we might see him a film while big boi already has a dogbreeding business says the dj  but in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double cd their greatness has become clear with speakerboxxxthe love below we havent seen the last of them he adds outkasts musical career spans  years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past with their debut southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum but it took until  for the pair to score their first hit in the uk with ms jackson while their album stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the us  xtras g money says it took the latest album released in  for him to be assured of their genius they have always been experimental some of it has worked and some hasnt he adds but g money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough what can you do next when youve done it all he says with ten years of success behind them and worldwide fame it seems that outkast is not a name that is likely to be forgotten in a hurry 
franz man seeks government help  franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion  for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he said  kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotlands role in making st century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent selfsufficient he said but socalled commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea  kapranos and his glasgow fourpiece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks brit awards including best group and best album their selftitled debut album won last years mercury music prize and spawned three top  singles he told the strong audience at the universitys reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm  he concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i dont really care about the brits he said its going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight  i think the government should do more to help upandcoming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels  rather than expecting the government  ie the taxpayer  to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in some of britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government funds  if they can fund football why not fund music  areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash  the government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multibillion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that  as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods  i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multimillion pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship  yes the government should fund music  it brings joy to the masses  there are already thousands of statefunded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use  as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idoltype funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about  only if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales  if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician the government shouldnt fund music  it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment  i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there  i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great deal  yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bandsartists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities  i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music  perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music  that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you like  though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privatelyfunded organizations like save the music in the us

critics back aviator for oscars  martin scorseses the aviator will win best film at the oscars according to the uks leading movie critics  but several of those surveyed by the bbc news website think the veteran filmmaker will lose the best director prize to clint eastwood most of the critics tipped jamie foxx and hilary swank to scoop best actor and actress for ray and million dollar baby respectively the jury comprised experts and critics from the top uk film publications the panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win  all expect the aviator to win best film but many think it will be a close race between scorseses howard hughes biopic and eastwoods boxing drama million dollar baby the other films nominated are wine comedy sideways factual drama finding neverland and ray charles biopic ray  im pretty sure this is the year of the aviator though my own choice would be sideways said the observers philip french sideways should win but it doesnt have a hope said jamie graham of total film a position shared by film  presenter jonathan ross the form going in to the oscars points to the aviator but i liked million dollar baby more said tim dams news editor of trade weekly screen international  five of the eight critics tipped scorsese to win best director with mr dams heats charles gant and empires angie errigo plumping for eastwood sideways alexander payne rays taylor hackford and british director mike leigh  nominated for period drama vera drake  are considered outsiders in this category up until recently i could have sworn scorsese would get it just for being scorsese ms errigo told the bbc news website but im beginning to think eastwood will get it  id be very happy for mike leigh to win but i dont think he has any chance said charles gant film editor of heat foxxs portrayal of ray charles has already seen him win prizes at the golden globes baftas and screen actors guild awards mr dams said this made him outandout favourite to be named best actor on oscar night everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didnt win he said if youre a betting man hes as close as you get to a certainty if paul giamatti was nominated for sideways it would be a different game says total films jamie graham but foxx will and should win  with vera drake star imelda staunton nominated for best actress alongside kate winslet britain has a good chance of victory  on paper jonathan ross for one will be very happy if winslet wins for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but while wendy ide of the times still thinks staunton has a chance heats charles gant believes her bafta win will cut little ice with academy voters id like staunton to win but her chances are not that great said mr gant who predicted a second oscar for hilary swank  i think swank will win said mr french imelda has got as far as shes going to get playing that role staunton is also the personal choice of steven gaydos executive editor of industry magazine variety but while he tipped swank to win he predicted it would be a close contest everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way he told the bbc news website theres not a sense that its obvious how its going to go meanwhile thousands of people have voted in a bbc radio five live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture oscar the audience voted overwhelmingly for the shawshank redemption the  frank darabont tale of hope and humanity which received  of the online votes and  of the text messages the other two finalists citizen kane and a
